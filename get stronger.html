    <h1>Tips On How To Get Stronger</h1>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2 dir="ltr">Tip #1 &ndash; Warm-up by working-up</h2>
    <p>Do several warm-up sets before you go into your work set. This will get you warmed-up, your joints lubricated and your nervous system all fired up.</p>
    <p>If for example you&rsquo;re trying to deadlift 400 lbs then you&rsquo;d start by doing 5 reps using 50% of the work weight. For the second warm-up set you&rsquo;d do 3 reps with 70%, third set 2 reps with 80% and lastly for the last warm-up set, 1 rep using 90% of the work weight.</p>
    <p>Take at least one minute and a half of rest between the warm-up sets and at least 2 minutes rest between the last warm-up set and the work set.</p>
    <h2 dir="ltr">Tip #2 &ndash; Visualize your work sets</h2>
    <p>Use your rest periods wisely. If you&rsquo;re having doubts in your mind whether you&rsquo;ll be able to complete the next set, try closing your eyes and start to visualize, how you&rsquo;re lifting the target weight as if it were light like a feather. Imagine that you&rsquo;re lifting your weight for hundred reps as if it were nothing.</p>
    <p>Make sure that during the visualization process you keep your fists tightly clenched. This will help you build focus and aggressiveness.</p>
    <h2 dir="ltr">Tip #3 &ndash; Increase your rest periods</h2>
    <p>In order to exert maximal force during a work set, you need to make sure that your body regenerates as much ATP as possible. ATP stands for adenosine triphosphate and it&rsquo;s our bodies primary fuel source. Get at least 3 to 5 minutes of rest in between your sets, so your ATP levels can be adequately regenerated.</p>
    <h2 dir="ltr">Tip #4 &ndash; Train with someone stronger than you</h2>
    <p>That&rsquo;s actually a no-brainer. By having a training partner stronger than you, you&rsquo;ll be more motivated to give all you&rsquo;ve got during your workout session. If you don&rsquo;t have a training partner, you can invite the biggest guy in the gym to spot you.</p>
    <p>Having someone you&rsquo;re inspired or intimidated by near when lifting, will make you crank up the intensity.</p>
    <h2 dir="ltr">Tip #5 &ndash; Load the bar with as few plates as possible</h2>
    <p>This means using the heaviest plates available, so the bar doesn&rsquo;t look that loaded. Some people say that doing the contrary &ndash; loading the bar with many small plates &ndash; will do the trick, but in my experience loading the bar with many small plates, will just make the bar look heavier.</p>
    <h2 dir="ltr">Tip #6 &ndash; Lift barefoot or wear shoes with a thin sole</h2>
    <p>The less material there is between your foot and the ground, the greater the amount of muscle you&rsquo;ll be able to recruit during the work set. The best option would be to train barefoot, but if your gym doesn&rsquo;t allow it, then use a shoe that has thin soles. An example of shoes with thin soles are Chuck Taylors.</p>
    <h2 dir="ltr">Tip #7 &ndash; Activate your glutes</h2>
    <p>Gluteus maximus (buttock muscle) is the largest muscle in our bodies. It&rsquo;s supposed to play a major role when deadlifting and squatting, but due to our sedentary lifestyles our buttocks are becoming increasingly weaker.</p>
    <p>You want to make sure that you have your glutes ready to fire before doing heavy sets of deadlifts and squats, otherwise you&rsquo;ll risk injury (to the hamstrings) and sub par lifting capacity.</p>
    <p>The best way to activate your glutes is by doing glute bridges. Two sets of eight reps should be enough to activate them.</p>
    <p>The proper way to do glute bridges is to lie on your back with your knees bent and feet close to your butt. Dig your heels into the floor and bridge up with your hips, focusing on the contraction in your glutes.</p>
    <p>At first you&rsquo;ll probably feel your lower back and hamstrings the most, but keep doing the glute bridges for a couple of days and you&rsquo;ll soon notice the glutes coming more and more into play.</p>
    <p>Glue activation is probably the most important tip of them all, not only because of the strength gains but also for the overall well being.</p>
    <h2 dir="ltr">Tip #8 &ndash; Use lifting chalk</h2>
    <p>Chalk or magnesium carbonate will help you keep your hands dry, immediately increasing your lifting ability. If you don&rsquo;t like the mess of powdered chalk, you can buy&nbsp;liquid chalk.</p>
    <h2 dir="ltr">Tip #9 &ndash; Wear a lifting belt</h2>
    <p>A lifting belt will help you support your back during heavy sets of deadlifts, squats and bench. It does so by increasing the abdominal pressure which in turn enables you to immediately increase your maxes by tens of pounds.</p>
    <p>Use the lifting belt only on really heavy sets of deadlifts and squats. Don&rsquo;t wear a lifting belt during the whole workout, it&rsquo;s counter productive.</p>
    <h2 dir="ltr">Tip #10 &ndash; Try the hook grip</h2>
    <p>If you find that during the deadlift your grip is failing you faster than your other muscles, consider adopting the hook grip.</p>
    <p>The hook grip is done by first wrapping the thumbs around the bar and then wrapping the remaining fingers around your thumbs. This gripping technique greatly increases your grip strength.</p>
    <p>It takes a while to get accustomed to this kind of grip technique but you&rsquo;ll get it eventually.</p>
