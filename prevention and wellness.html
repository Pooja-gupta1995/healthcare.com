    <p>Prevention and Wellness  Giving people the tools to stay healthy is as important as  helping them when they are sick. By encouraging healthy  lifestyles, we can help reduce preventable diseases.  Prevention and wellness include healthy behaviors such as</p>
    <p>:  &bull; eating a well balanced diet  &bull; regular physical activity  &bull; annual doctors visits for physical examinations  &bull; following a doctor&rsquo;s directions, like advice to stop smoking  Preventing Chronic Disease  In the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  (CDC) estimate that chronic diseases, most of which are  preventable, accounted for 75 percent of the $2 trillion  spent on health care in 2005. Yet, less than $10 per person  per year is spent on preventive health care in the U.S.  Studies have shown that chronic diseases, such as heart  disease and diabetes, are more common in the U.S.  compared to European countries. This is partly because  more Americans than Europeans practice unhealthy  behaviors. For example, 33 percent of Americans are  obese, compared to 17 percent in Europe. Fifty-three  percent of Americans are smokers, while only 43 percent of  Europeans smoke.1  Americans, Europeans and people around the world can  help prevent chronic diseases by developing healthy habits  early. It&rsquo;s also important to maintain those habits even  when sick. That&rsquo;s because a healthy lifestyle can help slow down the advance of illness, even if it doesn&rsquo;t prevent it  altogether.</p>
    <p> The CDC estimates that 40 percent of cancer,  as well as 80 percent of heart disease, stroke, and type 2  diabetes, could be prevented if Americans exercised more,  stopped smoking, and ate healthier.  Taking Action  Many years ago, Johnson & Johnson began promoting  healthy lifestyles among our employees. A system  of company-wide incentives was established to help  employees live healthier lives. The program includes:  &bull; Health Assessment & Counseling to help employees  understand and reduce their health risks.  &bull; Opportunities for employees to be physically active through  activities and initiatives offered by our companies, some  of which provide on-site fitness centers, exercise classes,  personal training and health coaching.  &bull; Preventive screenings covered at 100 percent under the  Healthy People Medical Plan.  This approach has helped to improve health and reduced  costs, both for the Johnson & Johnson companies and for  employees.2 We encourage health care systems around the  world to adopt a similar approach.  We also work with others to help reduce the rate of chronic  disease through such programs as:  &bull; The Partnership to Fight Chronic Disease, a coalition to  reduce chronic diseases through awareness, policy changes,  and disease prevention and management.</p>
    <p>The Campaign to End Obesity, a public-private collaborative effort to fight America&rsquo;s obesity  epidemic.  &bull; The CEO Cancer Gold Standard&trade;, a U.S. initiative created by the CEO Roundtable on Cancer, Inc.,  which is committed to fighting cancer. Johnson & Johnson Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,  William Weldon, chairs the CEO Roundtable.  &bull; America On the Move&reg;, a national non-profit organization working to promote healthful eating and  active living among individuals, families and communities. SPLENDA&reg; No Calorie Sweetener, from  McNeil Nutritionals, LLC, is a national program sponsor.  &bull; Our creation of the Johnson & Johnson Diabetes Institute, LLC, a network of centers to be  established in Japan, the U.S., France and China by year-end 2008 to provide physicians,  nurses, physician assistants and diabetes educators with training on the latest diabetes treatment  standards, tools and technologies, and cost-effective solutions.  &bull; Our many global giving programs that support community-based initiatives to prevent and reduce  the impact of chronic diseases and prevent HIV/AIDS infections.  &bull; Our engagement with the Oxford Health Alliance, which helps experts from around the world  raise awareness and enhance health behaviors, policies and perspective at every level of society.  Members include academics, corporate executives, patients&rsquo; rights advocates, doctors, and nurses. </p>
